Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## NAME: JOHN PALL M
## Reg. No. 212224040140

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

 Steps for Creating ASD Objective Screening Project
 Problem Identification
• Define what Autism Spectrum Disorder is.
• Highlight challenges in current subjective screening methods (e.g., bias, late
diagnosis, lack of accessibility).
• State the goal: to explore or develop an objective, technology-based
screening tool.
 Literature Review
• Study existing screening methods (e.g., ADOS, M-CHAT).
• Review research on objective approaches:
o Eye-tracking
o Speech and voice analysis
o Gaze patterns
o EEG/Brainwave analysis
o Machine Learning models trained on behavior data
• Identify gaps and limitations.
 Methodology Design
• Choose the objective metric: facial expression, speech delay, eye contact, etc.
• Decide on the data source: videos, images, audio, wearable sensors.
• Select appropriate tools/technologies:
o Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, or MATLAB for AI analysis
o Clinical data or public ASD datasets (e.g., ABIDE, NDAR)
 Data Collection & Preprocessing
• Collect video/audio/image data of children with and without ASD.
• Annotate or label the data.
• Preprocess: resize, normalize, denoise, segment behaviors.
 Model Development / Screening Tool Creation
• Use machine learning or pattern recognition to build a classifier.
• Example: CNN model for detecting lack of eye contact or facial expression
delay.
• Train & validate the model using cross-validation.
 Evaluation
• Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
• Compare with existing screening methods.
• Test on unseen clinical or real-world data.
 Ethics & Privacy
• Ensure informed consent for data use.
• Anonymize subject data.
• Follow institutional and legal research ethics.
 Deployment or Presentation
• Build a user interface (e.g., web app, mobile app, or hospital dashboard).
• Present findings through charts, confusion matrices, ROC curves.
• Suggest how this tool can complement existing ASD diagnosis workflows.
 Optional: Future Scope
• Expand to multilingual or cross-cultural screening.
• Integrate wearable data (heartbeat, movement).
• Collaborate with pediatricians, neurologists, or therapists.

 ASD Screening Using Machine Learning (ML-Based
Approach)
This approach uses pre-extracted features (e.g., facial landmarks, eye contact, gaze angle,
head orientation) to train an ML classifier.
 Step-by-Step Plan
1. Data Collection
o Use video or image datasets of individuals with and without ASD.
o Collect or extract features related to facial expression, gaze, head movement.
2. Feature Extraction
o Use MediaPipe, dlib, or OpenCV to extract:
▪ Eye contact ratio
▪ Mouth openness
▪ Facial emotion score
▪ Head tilt angle
3. Model Training
o Train an ML model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) on
labeled feature vectors.
4. Prediction
o Use trained model to classify new samples as "ASD" or "Non-ASD".
 Sample Python Code: ASD Classification using Random Forest

CopyEdit
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
import joblib
# Step 1: Load extracted features (as CSV)
# Sample features: eye_contact_ratio, head_tilt_angle, mouth_openness,
emotion_score
df = pd.read_csv('asd_features.csv')
# Step 2: Split into input and output
X = df.drop('label', axis=1) # Features
y = df['label'] # 0 = Non-ASD, 1 = ASD
# Step 3: Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2,
random_state=42)
# Step 4: Train Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Step 5: Evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
# Step 6: Save the model
joblib.dump(model, 'asd_ml_model.pkl')
 To Predict New Input
python
CopyEdit
# Load model
model = joblib.load('asd_ml_model.pkl')
# New sample input: [eye_contact_ratio, head_tilt, mouth_openness,
emotion_score]
sample = np.array([[0.3, 15, 0.05, 0.6]]) # example values
prediction = model.predict(sample)
print("Prediction:", "ASD" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Non-ASD")
 Example Feature CSV Structure (asd_features.csv)
eye_contact head_tilt mouth_open emotion_score label
0.4 12 0.03 0.5 1
0.7 5 0.01 0.8 0
